Our project generated a custom neural network with 4 layers, that solves the desired plant classification problem.

To run the code, simply download the training data to a folder with the python scripts, and run train_model.py. To generate predictions, run test_model.py.
The train_model.py script will generate a plant_classifier.pth pytorch model that the test_model.py script uses.
